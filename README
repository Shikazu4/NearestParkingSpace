Nearest Parking Spaces Finder

This is a web application that displays the nearest parking spaces based on a user's location using Leaflet.js for map rendering and routing. The backend is powered by Flask, and geolocation functionalities are implemented using the geopy library.

Features
Displays a map centered on the user's location.
Fetches and displays nearby parking spaces.
Draws routes from the user's location to the nearest parking space.
Custom markers for user location and parking spaces.
Responsive and interactive map interface

PS: Distances calculated are very basic shortest paths, not actual route lenght using roads, We can integrate Google Maps API if needed
I have used dummy location co-ordinates because I'm here in India, we can replace with actual user location
